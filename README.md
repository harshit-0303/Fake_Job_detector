# Fake Job Posting Detector üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A machine learning-based web application that detects fraudulent job postings using XGBoost and Logistic Regression models.
The app leverages TF-IDF text features, categorical features, and custom numeric features to accurately classify job postings as real or fake.

## Features

Predictive Models: Supports both XGBoost and Logistic Regression for binary classification.  
Text Analysis: Uses TF-IDF vectorization (unigrams + bigrams) to extract meaningful patterns from job posting text.  
Categorical Feature Handling: One-hot encoding for features like employment_type, required_experience, and required_education.  
Custom Features: Includes numeric features such as description length, suspicious keyword count, and number of exclamation marks.  
Interactive UI: Built using Streamlit for easy and intuitive web-based predictions.  
Scalable: Lightweight and deployable on Streamlit Cloud, Render, or Heroku.
